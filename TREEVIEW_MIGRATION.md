# TreeViewManager Implementation Summary

## What was accomplished:

### ✅ **Migrated to TreeViewManager**
- **Created** `js/tree-view-manager.js` - A clean, modular class that manages the interactive study plan tree view
- **Created** `js/app-tree.js` - Simple application entry point that uses TreeViewManager
- **Updated** `tree-view-styles.css` - Minimal styles that work with the original subject-btn styling from styles.css

### ✅ **Preserved Original UI/UX**
- **Subject styling**: Uses the original `subject-btn` class structure from `styles.css`
- **Color scheme**: Maintains the original colors:
  - Available: Gray (`#e2e8f0`)
  - Approved: Sky blue (`#bfdbfe`) 
  - Exonerated: Green (`#bbf7d0`)
  - Unavailable: Light gray with reduced opacity
- **Layout**: Uses the original compact button layout with `.code`, `.credits` elements

### ✅ **Study Plan Always Visible**
- **Removed toggle functionality** - The study plan (plan_recomendado) is now always displayed when available
- **Automatic rendering**: When a profile is selected, if it has a plan_recomendado, it's immediately shown
- **Fallback**: If no plan_recomendado exists, shows subjects organized by categories (core/optional/suggested)

### ✅ **Clean Architecture**
- **Self-contained**: TreeViewManager handles all tree view functionality in one file
- **Modular**: Easy to maintain, extend, and debug
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing profile data and UCS data

### ✅ **Preserved Functionality**
- **Three-state approval**: Click to cycle through available → approved → exonerated → available
- **Prerequisites validation**: Can't approve subjects until prerequisites are met
- **LocalStorage persistence**: Subject approval states are saved and restored
- **Credit counting**: Real-time credit calculation and status display
- **Profile/emphasis support**: Full support for profiles with different emphases

### ✅ **Removed Old Files**
- **Deleted**: `js/graph-simple.js` (replaced by tree-view-manager.js)
- **Deleted**: `js/app-new.js` (replaced by app-tree.js)  
- **Deleted**: `js/subject-status-manager.js` (functionality integrated into TreeViewManager)

## File Structure:
```
js/
├── tree-view-manager.js    # Main tree view logic (NEW)
├── app-tree.js             # Simple app entry point (NEW)
├── profile-manager.js      # (Existing, still used)
├── ui-manager.js           # (Existing, still used)
└── ... (other existing modules)

tree-view-styles.css        # Tree-specific styles (UPDATED)
styles.css                  # Original styles with subject-btn (UNCHANGED)
index.html                  # Updated to use app-tree.js (UPDATED)
```

## Result:
The study plan is now always visible, uses the original UI styling, and provides a clean, maintainable codebase focused specifically on the tree view functionality.
